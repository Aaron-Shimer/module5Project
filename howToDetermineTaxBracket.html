<h3>PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM</h3>
    <p>Federal taxes are based on progressive model. This means that the more money you make the higher you are taxed. However, this does not mean that if you are single and make $9,950 your entire income is taxed at 12%. The first $9,950 is taxed at 10% and the rest at 12%.</p>
